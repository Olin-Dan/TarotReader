# TarotReader
A self-learning project build on C#

The basic idea of this program was to randomly draw 3 cards from a tarot deck, and generate from those a short luck reading.

My intention was just to study some basic functionalities of csharp, rather than build a functional program.
Thus the lack of any user interface, and the placeholders for the luck reading, instead of words that would make an actual sentence.
